This is a fun Python simulation of a Coffee Machine that serves **espresso**, **latte**, and **cappuccino** — just like your local café... except this one talks in code! 😄

- Checks resources before making coffee (milk, water, coffee beans)
- Tracks available resources and updates after every order
- Returns change if overpaid
- Lets user turn the machine OFF or see a detailed report

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python 3
- Dictionaries and functions
- Loops, conditionals, and formatted strings

## 🧠 What I Learned

- How to simulate machines using conditionals and loops
- Managing nested dictionaries
- Handling user input in real-world style projects
